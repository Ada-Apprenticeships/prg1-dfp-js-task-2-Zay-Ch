1. Why do you put a ! in front of fs.existsSync(indata)?
The ! operator is a logical NOT operator in JavaScript. It negates the value of the expression that follows it.

fs.existsSync(indata) returns true if the file exists and false if it does not.
By using !fs.existsSync(indata), we check if the file does not exist. If it doesn't exist, the condition evaluates to true, and we can handle that case (e.g., by returning -1).


2. What does writeFileSync do?
writeFileSync is a method from the fs (file system) module in Node.js that synchronously writes data to a file.

If the file does not exist, it creates a new file.
If the file already exists, it overwrites the file with the new data provided.
The syntax is fs.writeFileSync(path, data), where path is the file path and data is the content to write.


3. Why do we/should use UTF-8 encoding?
UTF-8 is a character encoding that can represent every character in the Unicode character set. It is widely used because:

It supports a vast range of characters from different languages.
It is backward compatible with ASCII, making it a safe choice for text files that may contain standard English characters.
Specifying UTF-8 encoding when reading or writing files ensures that characters are correctly interpreted and displayed, avoiding issues with character representation.


4. Is continue used to skip rows?
Yes, the continue statement is used in loops to skip the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop.

In the context of your code, if a line is empty or if itâ€™s the header row, the continue statement causes the loop to skip any further processing for that particular line and proceed to the next line.


5. What is a sentiment?
In the context of your code, "sentiment" typically refers to the emotional tone or attitude expressed in a piece of text (e.g., a review).

In your code, it is derived from the second part of the split line (e.g., "positive", "negative"). The sentiment is a classification that can be useful for analysis, such as determining the overall positivity or negativity of reviews.



6. Why is parts[0] used in the line const review = parts[0].trim().slice(0, 20);?
parts[0] refers to the first part of the split line, which, based on your data format, is expected to contain the review text.

The trim() method removes any leading or trailing whitespace from the review text.
The slice(0, 20) method is used to limit the review to the first 20 characters, ensuring that the output does not exceed a certain length.



7. How does the line fs.appendFileSync(outdata, '${sentiment};${review}\n'); work?
This line is intended to append a new line of text to the output file specified by outdata.

The appendFileSync method adds the specified content to the end of the file without overwriting the existing content.
The string template syntax ${sentiment};${review}\n is used to format the output line, where sentiment and review are variables containing the respective values. The \n at the end adds a newline character, ensuring that each entry is on a new line in the output file.
